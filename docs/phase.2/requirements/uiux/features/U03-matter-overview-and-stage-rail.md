## Objective
Summarize case health, blockers, and next actions with persistent stage rail

## Primary Users
- Assistant
- Lawyer
- Admin/Ops
- Client (where applicable)

## UX Outcomes
1. Reduce ambiguity around next action.
2. Reduce duplicate data entry.
3. Increase confidence through source and sync visibility.

## Functional Requirements
1. The screen or workflow must support: matter overview, blocker panel, next action.
2. UI must show state progression and actionable status labels.
3. UI must support explicit handling of exceptions and unresolved items.
4. UI must provide traceability to source data and workflow events.
5. UI must support role-appropriate actions and hide unauthorized actions.

## Interaction Requirements
1. Primary action, secondary action, and safe-cancel behavior must be explicit.
2. Loading, empty, error, and partial-data states must be designed.
3. Destructive or irreversible actions must require confirmation.

## Content and Information Requirements
1. Labels must use legal-operations terminology consistent with Phase 2 docs.
2. Helper text must explain why input is needed and what happens next.
3. Important statuses must include timestamp and actor when available.

## Accessibility and Usability Requirements
1. Keyboard-only flow must cover all core actions.
2. Focus order and focus visibility must remain logical in dialogs and side panels.
3. Screen reader labels must be present for all controls and status chips.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. User can complete primary task without leaving this feature.
2. User can identify unresolved items and next action in under 10 seconds.
3. Error state explains recovery path.
4. Audit-relevant actions are visible in timeline/log surfaces.

## Dependencies
- Backend endpoints and workflow states that supply feature data
- Shared design system components and role-based authorization

## Feature-Specific UI Requirements
1. Matter Overview must display next action, blockers, risk flags, and key deadlines.
2. Persistent stage rail must appear across all matter tabs.
3. Overview must surface missing document and unresolved data counts.
4. Side panel must summarize sync health and pending publish-back items.

## User Journey Requirements
1. Assistant opens matter and immediately understands what to do next.
2. Lawyer opens matter and sees legal-risk summary without deep navigation.
